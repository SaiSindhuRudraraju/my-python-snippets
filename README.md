# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python practice repository! 🚀  
This is where I store all the Python programs I write while learning the language—from basic syntax to more complex logic and small projects.

## 📂 Structure
- `basics/` – Fundamental syntax, loops, conditionals, functions, etc.
- `datastructures/` – Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- `problems/` – Practice questions and coding exercises
- `projects/` – Small standalone apps and scripts

## 💡 About
I'm using this space to track my progress and experiment with Python through real code. Whether it's solving a problem, writing utility scripts, or just exploring a new concept—it's all here.
